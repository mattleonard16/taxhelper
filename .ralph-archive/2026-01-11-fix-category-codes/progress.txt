Feature: UI Rework (plan/feature/08-ui-rework.md)

## Codebase Patterns
- Use shadcn/ui primitives from `src/components/ui` as base building blocks
- CSS variables in `src/app/globals.css` for design tokens
- Do NOT remove or rename existing Playwright `data-testid` hooks
- Preserve API shapes and business logic; this is UI/UX-first work
- Mobile-first responsiveness for all authenticated routes
