# Development Rules

Follow these rules for every task:

1. Create and checkout a new branch when starting a task.
2. Complete the task as described; prefer simplifying or removing code rather than adding new abstractions.
3. Run type-check, lint, and the full test suite without skipping or deleting tests; commit and push.
4. Update documentation whenever behavior, environment, or workflow changes.
