# Task 00 — Confirm Goal + Lock Scope

## Description

Choose the project’s next “big goal” (from `tasks/scope.md` or your own) and explicitly define the scope boundaries, priorities, and non-goals before implementing changes.

## Files / Modules Affected

- `tasks/scope.md`
- `tasks/task-*.md` (dependency ordering may change based on the selected goal)

## Dependencies

- None

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `tasks/scope.md` has a concrete Big Goal (not a placeholder)
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable (specific endpoints/pages/tests)
- [ ] Non-goals/out-of-scope items are listed to prevent scope creep

## Complexity

Low
