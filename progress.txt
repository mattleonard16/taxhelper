## [Mon Jan 13 01:31:00 PST 2026] - US-001
- Added TransactionPriority enum with HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW values
- Added priority field to Transaction model with default MEDIUM
- Created migration SQL for adding priority column and indexes
- Successfully generated Prisma client and types
- Typecheck completed without errors
- Test suite passed (1 pre-existing unrelated failure in summary.test.ts)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- The project uses Prisma with PostgreSQL database
- Migrations follow naming pattern: YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_descriptive_name
- Database may not be locally connected during development - migrations can be created manually
- Prisma client generation validates schema syntax
- Always run typecheck (`npx tsc --noEmit`) and test suite before committing changes
- Project uses composite indexes for common query patterns (userId with other fields)
